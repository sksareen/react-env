# JSX Renderer Test Suite

This test suite helps identify and fix issues with the JSX and TypeScript rendering in the React Sandbox environment.

## Components

1. **Test Components**
   - `basic-jsx.jsx` - Simple static component with no hooks
   - `hooks-jsx.jsx` - Component using React hooks
   - `basic-typescript.tsx` - TypeScript component with interfaces
   - `debug-console.jsx` - Logs environment information to console

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - `test-runner.jsx` - Main component to orchestrate all tests
   - `manual-test.js` - Directly tests Babel transformation
   - `raw-jsx-string.js` - Contains a JSX string for testing

3. **Enhanced Renderers**
   - `custom-jsx-parser.js` - Improved TypeScript parser
   - `jsx-renderer-replacement.js` - Simplified renderer
   - `enhanced-renderer.jsx` - Complete replacement for JSXRenderer

## How to Use

1. **Run the Test Runner**
   - Load `test-runner.jsx` in the sandbox to see overall test status
   - Manually mark tests as passed/failed based on your observations

2. **Test Components Individually**
   - Try loading each test component in the sandbox
   - Observe which types of components work or fail

3. **Try the Enhanced Renderer**
   - Replace `JSXRenderer.js` with `enhanced-renderer.jsx` to see if it resolves the issues

## Expected Test Results

| Test | Success Criteria |
|------|------------------|
| File Loading | Component loads without errors |
| Basic JSX | Static component renders correctly |
| Hooks JSX | Component with hooks works interactively |
| TypeScript | TypeScript syntax is correctly transformed |
| Babel Transform | Manual Babel tests succeed |

## Diagnosis and Solutions

Based on your test results, here are the likely issues and solutions:

1. **TypeScript Transformation Issues**
   - The TypeScript parser in JSXRenderer.js is not handling all syntax correctly
   - Solution: Use the enhanced TypeScript parser in `custom-jsx-parser.js`

2. **Syntax Error Handling**
   - The error at line 65:88 suggests issues with object literals or braces
   - Solution: Fix specific syntax patterns in the parser

3. **Babel Configuration**
   - Babel might not be configured correctly for TypeScript
   - Solution: Test different Babel preset configurations

4. **File Loading**
   - File loading logic might not handle TypeScript correctly
   - Solution: Check the file reading logic in Sandbox.js

## Implementation Plan

The recommended approach is to:

1. First try the `enhanced-renderer.jsx` as a drop-in replacement
2. If that doesn't work, incrementally update the TypeScript parsing in JSXRenderer.js
3. Add better error reporting to help diagnose specific syntax issues

The most likely issue is with TypeScript interface handling and function syntax parsing.
